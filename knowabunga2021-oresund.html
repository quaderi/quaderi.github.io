My experiences have been quite varied, from creating games to full blown web-based intranet platforms.</p><p>Because of this variation and these experiences I’ve found that I’ve acquired a thirst for front-end development and anything web related, which can range from mobile apps to web-based SaaS solutions. The fact that you can create ANYTHING with almost nothing is an exhilarating feeling. It’s one of the major reasons that keeps me going; the only limit is my imagination.</p><p>I absolutely love to travel and experience new cultures (and food!) when the opportunity presents itself. My goal in life is to visit as many places and experience as many different cultures as I possibly can. So far I can cross off Europe and half of Asia from my list, and I look forward to many more exciting adventures to come.</p> "

There was a time where he was struggling to handle multiple projects at the same time, so he encouraged me to join him in the journey. After completing some small projects - using simple UI designs - it became my passion.This passion drives me even up until this moment and it still makes me forget about the time as I focus on providing a better solution for the challenges that I’m facing all the time. Yes, this passion that I am talking about is like an engine inside me that would work without fuel, something infinite, only for one reason and that is I love what I do. I have always believed that Front-end development is a thing that I would love, because it always brings me some fresh challenges to think about, makes me use all my effort and thought in order to provide a better solution.Thinking about the years that have passed by so far - deep diving in heart of the front end technologies and finding out about all it’s nuts and bolts and filling out my days and nights with it - brings a smile to my face. This smile is because I can look at myself and know that I've been enjoying some of the best times of my life, and I’m really glad that I've chosen the right thing for rest of it.Tech life aside, in my spare time I always love to go biking, hiking, and love to walk or run. I’m not good at cooking but I actually love the experience of cooking when there are no options left (only for survival purpose). If I’m not doing one of those things, you would probably find me in Github’s explore page or in stack overflow helping some tech fellows. "

			"text": " <p>My son (4 years of age) keeps asking me \"Daddy what do you do?\" and my answer is mostly \"well son, I work with people\" and the response is \"Ok, but what do you do?\". The truth is that I'm a jack of many trades but the one thing in common with everything I do is people. I have been working with people, for people, all my life. It started with selling freshly caught trout to elderly people in my neighbourhood during high school, as they rarely got the chance to get their hands on some.</p><p>In my mid-twenties, I counted all the things I had done at that time and realised that I had experienced over 20 professions varying from the odd construction gigs to bakery assistant to restaurant chef - I even cleaned public transport vehicles during nights in Helsinki while studying arts. That pretty much defines me both professionally and personally - I have never shied away from new things, responsibility or tasks of any kind, as long as I sensed that there is a possibility to learn something on the way. Good or bad, I find ways to enhance my understanding of myself, my surroundings and of people. Later on in life, I learned to channel this and found myself in a leadership role in a company that works for people and with people in distress, and here I found something that felt right. A role that was ever-changing and evolving, a role where you get challenged every day and foremost get to learn stuff and at the same time get to support and help your colleagues in their respective quests. I have been on this track for a decade now and not regretted a second of it, and now I can finally make sense of it to my kid: \"well son, Daddy is a ninja\" and my son replies \"wauu that's so cool Daddy, I want to be a ninja too, like kung-fu panda\". If my story does not point out what gives me most satisfaction in my job, here it comes: Learning, growing and having fun while doing it. </p><p>I'm a naturally curious person and I'm interested in learning more about the business that we operate in, all aspects of it and as much as possible for for someone who never really got around to delving into the deeper aspects of technology, but always enjoyed the benefits that it has brought us. When not dabbling in human understanding or enhancing my knowledge base professionally, you might find me at some obscure river or lake somewhere gathering my thoughts and trying to become a l33t fisherman. I am also very found of reading - especially historical fiction or fantasy in my spare time.</p> "

When my parents were not looking, me and my brother launched the i386 PC and tried to figure out how to launch classical games as Wolfenstein 3d, lemmings and battle chess from the DOS prompt. The way computers back then invited for curiosity to interact in different ways is the foundation that drives me to constantly enjoy new technology.</p><p>I have a strong passion for code and programming but what I value the most is the outcome - the interface that the users interacts with. As much as the browser landscape can be painful, I also embrace it. It's what once allowed me to be creative with frames, tables and spacer gifs and today utilising modern javascript (ES6), html and css.</p><p>Outside of digital life I enjoy playing with my three kids. To keep up with their energy I've become somewhat obsessed by long distance running. I've tried a couple of marathons and ultra marathons.
